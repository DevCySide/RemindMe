# RemindMe

The program stores input data in a structured text file, and everything is managed around it. You can add a reminder with a title, and its status is automatically set to "wip". When you complete it, the status field is updated with the completion date. You can also list your "wip" reminders in the CMD interface. 

You can mark a particular reminder as completed using its ID!

Since it’s a text file, the content can also be easily read and modified offline. However, depending on your screen size, the formatting may not always look perfect, so it’s recommended to use the program itself.

**Commands**

Here's the command list:

- tda: add a reminder (usage 'tda <title>: <reminder>')

- tdd: mark a reminder as completed (usage 'tdd <ID>')

- tdl: list of NOT completed reminder/s

- tdq: quit the program

- hel: print helper
